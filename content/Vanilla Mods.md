# Intro 
This is a vault that I built from obsidian and quartz. Even though I love quartz, it has not supported my plugins the way I want so I had to make modifications. This vault contains the modifications I made to them. 

- Changed baseUrl in `quartz.config.ts`
- Changed pageTitle in `quartz.config.ts`

# Added more refrence notes
- Added more notes from [Other Public Second Brains (ssp.sh)](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/other-public-second-brains/) to [[showcase]]
