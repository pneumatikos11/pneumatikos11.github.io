- Welcome to STM32 Projects and Tutorials
# Quick heads up and guidelines
- All links to products and services are not sponsored or affiliate links unless specified as such
- All the tutorials are made with Windows (10&11) OS
- Most parts are not visited for a long while so they made not work directly especially months or years after first publication due to many factors such as OS changes, driver changes and library changes. 
# Flashing STM with compiled code
Over the course of the blogs/tutorials, I would assume you would know how to flash the STM32 with the code form the STM32CubeIDE. You could
1. [[Using Arduino as FTDI|Use an Arduino board]]
2. Use an FTDI
3. Use the ST-Link programmer. You could also make a programmer from a bluepill from [[Converting Blue Pill to ST Link V2|here]]
